	"Bestow upon me knowledge Wizard—all knowing, all wise I want to rule this kingdom Make sweet the breeze now defiled Dethrone the evil prince's iron fists In velvet gloves of sin Parade the grey-robed monks The vestal virgins, wheel the wyvern's in Let the ceremony consecrate the marriage Let me be the protege of five magics Give me alchemy, give me wizardy, Give me sorcery, thermatology Electricity, magic if you please, Master all of these, bring him to his knees I master five magics, I master five magics I master five magics, I master five magics Possessed with hellish torment, possessed with hellish torment I master magics five, I master magics five Hunting the abyss lord, hunting the abyss lord Only one will stay alive, only one will stay alive He who lives by the sword, he who lives by the sword Will surely also die, will surely also die He who lives in sin, he who lives in sin Will surely live the lie",
	"I miss the warm embrace I felt First time you touched me Secure and safe in open arms I should have known you'd crush me A snake you were when we met I loved you anyway Pulling out your poisoned fangs The venom never goes away Serpent swims free in my blood Dragons sleeping in my veins Jackyl speaking with tongue Roach egg laying in my brain Once stalked beneath your shadow Sleepwalking to the gallows I'm the sun that beats your brow in 'til I finally threw the towel in Never knowing if I'd wake up in a Whirlpool got redundant My brain was just some driftwood In a cesspool I became dead From a rock star to a desk fool Was my destiny someone said Love's a tide pool Taste the waters life's abundant Taste me",
	"Sitting up late at night A tiptoe through the darkness Cold as hell black as spades Aware of my immediate surrounding In my place I escape Up into my hideout Hiding from everyone My friends all say Dave your mental anyway hey! Drift into a deeper state I stalk the cobwebbed stairways Dirt grits beneath me feet The stair creaks, I precariously sneak Hypnosis guides my hand I slipside through the walkways Sit in granny's rockin' chair Memories are whirling by yeah Reminisce in the attic Lucretia waits impatiently Cobwebs make me squint The cobra so eloquently glints Moonbeams surge through the sky The crystal ball's energized Surely that like the cat waiting Lucretia rocks away",

	"Thermal count is rising In perpetual writhing The primordial ooze And the sanity they lose Awakened in the morning To more air pollution warnings Still we sleepwalk off to work While our nervous systems jerk Pretending not to notice How history had forebode us With the green house in effect Our environment was wrecked Now I can only laugh As I read our epitaph We end our lives as moles In the dark of dawn patrol",
